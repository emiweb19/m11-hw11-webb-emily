        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p class="lead">
          Hi, I'm Emily Webb, a writer and marketer with an extensive background in higher education communications.
          I'm passionate about great storytelling and helping organizations meet their strategic goals by crafting
          compelling narratives and engaging content.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          I am a lifelong lover of reading and writing, and I chose to study journalism in my undergrad precisely
          because with every article, I got to be a storyteller. Through my interviews, I would get insight into a new
          world, and I would then be responsible for introducing that world to my readers in a way they would comprehend
          and appreciate.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          As I transitioned my career to marketing and public relations, I kept storytelling at the root of all my work,
          whether I'm writing about a $30 million grant for a campus facilities renovation, sending emails to
          prospective students, or developing a content plan for a Giving Day campaign.

        <h2>Career Goals</h2>
          <p>I currently work as the associate director of marketing and enrollment communications at Lees-McRae
                College where I have had the opportunity to tell incredible stories about this unique school and its
                students. I am also pursuing a master's degree in Mass Communications, with a specialization in Public
                Interest Communications, at the University of Florida. Following graduation, I intend to pursue new
                leadership opportunities working in nonprofit marketing and communications.</p>
        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
          <p>Outside of work, I try to keep myself busy. I enjoy reading, watching movies and TV shows, playing video games, traveling, exploring my town, playing board games, crafting, spending time with my husband and pets, and picking up new hobbies!</p>
